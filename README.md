# Chest X-Ray Classification for Respiratory Diseases

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based model for the automated classification of chest X-ray images into three categories: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as manual interpretation by radiologists, can be time-consuming and subjective. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques, this project seeks to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, facilitating early detection and intervention in respiratory diseases.

## Methodology

### Model 1: Pneumonia vs. Normal

- **Objective**: Binary classification of chest X-ray images into Pneumonia and Normal categories.
- **Approach**: Train a CNN model from scratch using diverse datasets of chest X-ray images.

### Model 2: COVID-19 vs. Pneumonia vs. Normal

- **Objective**: Multi-class classification of chest X-ray images into COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal categories.
- **Approach**: Utilize transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained CNN model for the three-class classification task.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified images.
- **Recall**: The ability of the model to identify all relevant instances of a class.
- **Precision**: The accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
